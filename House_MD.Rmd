Reddit both annoys me and inspires me sometimes.

Around a month ago, I was on Reddit wasting my time, as is usual of my daily routine.
Because of the recent COVID-19 dilemma that forces me indoors, I browsed *waaaay* longer
than I should have. 
Eventually, I go to [/r/dataisbeatiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/) and one of the posts
there caught my attention. 
[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/fwjces/oc_the_absolute_quality_of_breaking_bad/)
is quite nice in displaying the ratings of the episodes of a show, which in this case,
is Breaking Bad. Along with the side legend and pictures, it was a nice post.

However, after this post was made, I saw a flood of posts that were similar to this except 
with different shows. I got pretty irritated because it looked
like an easy karma grab for Reddit users.

Thus, we land here. I got inspired by these posts to work more with webscraping tools.
I did want to brush up on some of those tools, and I also wanted a new project
for visualization.
Here I'm using DT, which does have the capacity to make really nice looking tables.
 
I'll be using my two favorite shows: House MD and Monk.
I made a function that takes the link for a show on IMDB, and returns a table
of the ratings of each episode.
(I might make it user-inputtable in the future, since all it needs
is one string to run. Maybe like cin from C++, but in R? I would
need to be more familiar with Shiny for this to work.)

The function itself, with code:

```{r}
suppressMessages(library(rvest))     # scraping tool
suppressMessages(library(tidyverse)) # pipe function for readability
suppressWarnings(library(DT))        # making the final table look pretty
suppressMessages(library(stringr))   # regex with website

# our website of interest, 
# it's the only parameter we need to create a table
# (perhaps...)
IMDB_episode_ratings_table <- function(website){
  website <- website

  # what we want to extract from the website
  pattern <- "title/([a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])/" 

  # imdb title code as a string
  imdb_title <- str_match(website, pattern)[1,2]  
      

  # get number of seasons from the website
  seasons <- website %>% read_html() %>% 
           html_nodes(".clear+ div a:nth-child(1)") %>% 
           html_text() %>% as.numeric() 
  # making it into a vector is easier
  seasons <- 1:seasons                    

  seasonList <- list()       # empty list

  # for loop to extract ratings from website:
  # 1. we go in a page for one season
  # 2. acquire all ratings
  # 3. place the rating in our empty list
  # 4. repeat for all seasons
  for(i in seq_along(seasons)){
    # the html for each season differs by i
    seasonhtml <- paste("https://www.imdb.com/title/", 
                      imdb_title, 
                      "/episodes?season=", i, 
                      "&ref_=tt_eps_sn_", i, sep = "")
  
    # creates vector of ratings
    ratings <- seasonhtml %>% read_html() %>% 
    html_nodes(".ipl-rating-star.small .ipl-rating-star__rating") %>%
    html_text() %>% as.numeric() %>% as.data.frame()
  
    # place vector into i-th list position
     seasonList[i] <- ratings                                     
  }

  # part of a technique to create all vectors as equal length
  maxLength <- max(sapply(seasonList,length))       

  # expanding our list with the previous technique
  for(i in seq_along(seasonList)){
    length(seasonList[[i]]) <- maxLength            
  }

  # create a data frame from this list
  x <- as.data.frame(seasonList)

  # adding names to the data frame
  seasonName <- paste("Season ", seasons)
  episodeName <- paste("Ep. ", 1:nrow(x))
  row.names(x) <- episodeName
  colnames(x) <- seasonName

  # displaying the table with some colors
  datatable(x) %>% formatStyle(names(x), 
    backgroundColor = styleInterval(c(5.5,6.5,7.5,8.5),
      c("red","orange","yellow", "greenyellow","lawngreen"))
  )
}
```

There are colors that the function adds to the table. It basically works like this:
episodes between 8.6 to 10 are green, 7.6-8.5 are light green, 6.6-7.5 are yellow,
5.6-6.5 are orange, and anything below that is red.

With that, here's House MD's ratings:

```{r}
IMDB_episode_ratings_table("https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412142/")
```

And here's Monk's ratings:

```{r}
IMDB_episode_ratings_table("https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0312172/")
```
